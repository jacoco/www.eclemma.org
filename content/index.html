<p>
  EclEmma is a free Java code coverage tool for
  <a class="extern" href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a>, available under the 
  <a class="extern" href="license.html">Eclipse Public License</a>. It brings
  code coverage analysis directly into the Eclipse workbench:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Fast develop/test cycle:</b> Launches from within the workbench like
  JUnit test runs can directly be analyzed for code coverage.</li>
  <li><b>Rich coverage analysis:</b> Coverage results are immediately summarized
  and highlighted in the Java source code editors.</li>
  <li><b>Non-invasive:</b> EclEmma does not require modifying your projects or
  performing any other setup.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Since version 2.0 EclEmma is based on the
  <a href="http://www.jacoco.org/jacoco">JaCoCo</a> code
  coverage library. The Eclipse integration has its focus on supporting the
  individual developer in an highly interactive way. For automated builds please
  refer to <a href="http://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/trunk/doc">JaCoCo
  documentation</a> for
  <a href="http://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/integrations.html">integrations
  with other tools</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="installation1x.html">Originally</a> EclEmma was inspired by and
  technically based on the great 
  <a class="extern" href="http://emma.sourceforge.net/">EMMA</a> library
  developed by Vlad Roubtsov.
</p>

<p>
  The <a href="installation.html">update site</a> for EclEmma is 
  <b>https://update.eclemma.org/</b>. EclEmma is also available via the Eclipse
  <a class="extern" href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/marketplace-client-intro">Marketplace Client</a>,
  simply search for "EclEmma".
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Launching</h3>

<p>
  EclEmma adds a so called <i>launch mode</i> to the Eclipse workbench. It is
  called <i>Coverage</i> mode and works exactly like the existing <i>Run</i> and
  <i>Debug</i> modes. The <i>Coverage</i> launch mode can be activated from the
  <i>Run</i> menu or the workbench's toolbar:
</p>

<p>
  <img src="userdoc/images/launchtoolbar.gif" alt="Launching Toolbar" width="112" height="27" />
</p>

<p>
  Simply <a href="userdoc/launching.html">launch</a> your applications or unit
  tests in the <i>Coverage</i> mode to collect coverage information. Currently
  the following launch types are supported:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Local Java application</li>
  <li>Eclipse/RCP application</li>
  <li>Equinox OSGi framework</li>
  <li>JUnit test</li>
  <li>TestNG test</li>
  <li>JUnit plug-in test</li>
  <li>JUnit RAP test</li>
  <li>SWTBot test</li>
  <li>Scala application</li>
</ul>


<h3>Analysis</h3>

<p>
  On request or after your target application has terminated code coverage
  information is automatically available in the Eclipse workbench:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Coverage overview:</b> The
  <a href="userdoc/coverageview.html"><i>Coverage</i> view</a> lists coverage
  summaries for your Java projects, allowing drill-down to method level.</li>
  
  <li><b>Source highlighting:</b> The result of a coverage session is also 
  directly visible in the Java source editors. A customizable
  <a href="userdoc/annotations.html">color code</a> highlights fully, partly and
  not covered lines. This works for your own source code as well as for source
  attached to instrumented external libraries.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Additional features support analysis for your test coverage:
</p>

<ul>  
  <li><b>Different counters:</b> Select whether instructions, branches, lines,
  methods, types or cyclomatic complexity should be summarized.</li>
  <li><b>Multiple coverage sessions:</b> Switching between coverage data from
  multiple <a href="userdoc/sessions.html">sessions</a> is possible.</li>
  <li><b>Merge Sessions:</b> If multiple different test runs should be considered
  for analysis coverage sessions can easily be merged.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Import/Export</h3>

<p>
  While EclEmma is primarily designed for test runs and analysis within the
  Eclipse workbench, it provides some import/export features.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Execution data import:</b> A wizard allows to
  <a href="userdoc/importexport.html">import</a> JaCoCo <code>*.exec</code>
  execution data files from external launches.</li>
  <li><b>Coverage report export:</b> Coverage data can be
  <a href="userdoc/importexport.html">exported</a> in HTML, XML or CSV format or
  as JaCoCo execution data files (<code>*.exec</code>).</li>
</ul>
